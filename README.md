Our application displays random images on the main page taken in a Picsum database.
The user can add them to his personal gallery with the add button.
A new set of random pictures is generated if you shake the phone.
He can also search for friends via the "search" page and add them. The search is done with the email address
(example : gitlord@epitech.eu)
They will be visible in the "friends" page. The user can go to the pictures of his friends and add them on his own "gallery" page.

### Back-end

We chose to use Firebase because this suits all our requirements such as:
- Authentication
- Database

### Native functionalities

We used the accelerometer of the phone in order to detect shake movements which resets the random pictures displayed on the list of random pictures.

### Analytics
